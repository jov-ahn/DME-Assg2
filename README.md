# DME Assignment 2 Hintel App
 
## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

The purpose of this app was meant for higher management / owners of Boutique Hotels. It is meant to allow access to up-to-date information that is linked & constantly sycnhronised from an external [Database](https://github.com/jov-ahn/DDWA-Assg2.git). This would allow them access to the hotel's information such as expenses, room statuses, staff details, inventory item count , etc. Overall allowing for more improved processes, lesser negative customer experiences and lower risk of data loss on excel sheets.

As our theme was to design for a botique hotel on an app meant for higher management / owners of Botique Hotels, we had to decide on several factors first before diving deeper into the design process
- **Colour**
  - [Blue colour scheme](https://pin.it/4FIJtXo)
     - We based specific colour types based on colour psychology. As a hotel app is leaning towards the business industry where they are expected to act professional, serious but at the same time welcoming for customers. Blue can be defined as confidence, trustworthiness, success & professionalism. These definitions clearly align with what we envision and it's purpose for the app.
- Font Type
  - Sans Serif [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins&preview.text_type=custom#license)
    - Sans serif style font Poppins was chosen due to several reasons. One was due to how effortless it is to interpret it on digital screens, especially on smaller scale screen such as smart phones. Another reason was due to a more cleaner, unique & trendy style font face. As the app needed to feel exciting, motivating & professional from aesthetic wise, using commonly used font faces such as Arial not only limits the font weights that can be used, but also limits the aesthetics of the app due to it being over used as a web-safe font. We ensured that the font Poppins was web-safe by fact-checking the font and at the same time, using it from a legible source which was [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins&preview.text_type=custom&preview.text=the%20fried%20food#license)

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
### User Stories
  - As a higher up of a Boutique Hotel, I want to have an app that is exciting, motivating and professional to look at to feel better and more motivated to use the app in my work
  - As a higher up of a Boutique Hotel, I want to have data seperated into containers and / or cards for easier viewing of large amounts of information so that it is much faster, easier and more aesthetic to view at large amounts of information on an app than looking at data in large paragraphs on a single screen

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Log In / Out Form:
    1. Open the Hintel App
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid username and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with an invalid password and verify that a relevant error message appears
    5. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
